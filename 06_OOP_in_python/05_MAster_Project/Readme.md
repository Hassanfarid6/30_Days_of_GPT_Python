# 🚀 Day 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Today, you’ll dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is essential for writing modular, reusable, and scalable Python applications—especially for AI Agents and GenAI development.

---

## 📌 Objectives for Today:
- ✅ Understand Classes & Objects in Python.
- ✅ Learn about Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- ✅ Implement real-world OOP-based projects.
- ✅ Solve coding challenges using OOP concepts.

---

## 🛠 Tasks & Exercises:

### 1️⃣ Classes & Objects in Python

#### 📌 Concepts to Learn:
- Defining a Class and creating objects.
- Understanding instance variables vs. class variables.
- The `__init__` (constructor) method.

#### 🔹 Exercise:
- Create a `Car` class with attributes like `brand`, `model`, and `year`.
- Instantiate multiple objects and print their details.

---

### 2️⃣ Key OOP Principles

#### ✅ Encapsulation:
- Protect data using private & public attributes.

#### ✅ Inheritance:
- Create a child class that inherits methods and attributes from a parent class.

#### ✅ Polymorphism:
- Implement method overriding and operator overloading.

#### ✅ Abstraction:
- Use abstract classes to define a blueprint for other classes.

#### 🔹 Exercise:
- Create a `BankAccount` class with `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.
- Implement an `Employee` class that inherits from a `Person` class.
- Override the `speak()` method in different child classes (Polymorphism).

---

### 3️⃣ Build a Mini OOP-Based Project

#### ✅ To-Do List Manager:
- Create a `Task` class with attributes `title`, `description`, and `status`.
- Implement methods to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

#### ✅ Extra Challenge:
- Implement a library management system where users can borrow and return books.

---

### 4️⃣ Solve OOP-Based Coding Challenges

#### 🔹 Beginner Challenges:
- ✅ Create a class `Rectangle` with methods to calculate area and perimeter.
- ✅ Implement a `Student` class with a method to display student details.

#### 🔹 Advanced Challenges:
- ✅ Create a `Shape` class with an `area()` method and inherit `Circle` and `Square` classes from it.
- ✅ Implement an inventory management system using OOP.

## 🎯 Goal for Today:
By the end of Day 6, you should:
- ✅ Have a strong grasp of OOP principles.
- ✅ Be able to design and implement classes effectively.
- ✅ Build real-world applications using OOP.
- ✅ Solve multiple coding challenges using OOP concepts.
