# ðŸ“Œ Tower of Hanoi
"""
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in recursion. The goal is to move `n` disks from the source peg (A) 
to the target peg (C) using an auxiliary peg (B), following these rules:

### Rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks must be moved from the source peg to the target peg.

### Key Points:
1. **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, move the disk directly from the source peg to the target peg.
2. **Recursive Case:** 
   - Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
   - Move the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.
   - Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

### Example:
For `n = 3` disks:
1. Move 2 disks from A to B (using C as auxiliary).
2. Move the 3rd disk from A to C.
3. Move 2 disks from B to C (using A as auxiliary).

The steps are printed as instructions for each move.
