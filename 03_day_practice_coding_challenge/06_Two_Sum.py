# Question : Two Sum
# Problem:

# Write a function two_sum(numbers, target) that takes a list of integers numbers 
# and an integer target as input. The function should return a list containing the
# indices of two numbers in numbers that add up to target. You may assume that each
# input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice 
# (i.e., the two indices must be different). If no solution exists, return an empty list.

# Requirements:
# Return the indices in any order.
# Use a solution with less than O(n²) time complexity if possible.

# Examples:
# two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) → [0, 1] (because numbers[0] + numbers[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)
# two_sum([3, 2, 4], 6) → [1, 2] (because numbers[1] + numbers[2] = 2 + 4 = 6)
# two_sum([3, 3], 6) → [0, 1] (because numbers[0] + numbers[1] = 3 + 3 = 6)
# two_sum([1, 2, 3], 10) → [] (no pair sums to 10)

# Plan:
# 1. Create a dictionary to store the index of the numbers.
# 2. Iterate through the list and find the difference between the target and the current number.
# 3. If the difference is in the dictionary, return the index of the current number and the index
#    of the difference.
# 4. If the difference is not in the dictionary, add the current number and its index to the 
#    dictionary.
# 5. If no solution is found, return an empty list.

def two_sum(numbers, target):
    """Find indices of two numbers in a list that add up to the target."""
    # Dictionary to store number-to-index mappings
    seen_numbers = {}
    
    # Iterate through the list with index and value
    for index, current_num in enumerate(numbers):
        # Calculate the number needed to reach the target
        complement = target - current_num
        
        # If the complement exists in the dictionary, we found a pair
        if complement in seen_numbers:
            return [seen_numbers[complement], index]
        
        # Otherwise, add the current number and its index
        seen_numbers[current_num] = index
    
    # No pair found after checking all numbers
    return []

# Test cases
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 18)) # [1, 2]
print(two_sum([3, 2, 4], 6)) # [1, 2]
print(two_sum([3, 3], 6)) # [0, 1]
print(two_sum([1, 2, 3], 5)) # []
print(two_sum([1, 2, 3], 10)) # []

# Second Approach:


def two_sum1(numbers, target):
    """Find two numbers that add to target using nested loops."""
    # Check each pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    return []  # No pair found

# Pros: Extremely clear—no data structures, just basic loops and addition.
# Cons: O(n²) time, doesn’t meet the efficiency preference.
