## üìå Objectives for Day 7:
1. **Understand Asynchronous Programming Concepts**:
   - Distinguish between synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) execution.
   - Recognize when async programming is beneficial (e.g., I/O-bound tasks).

2. **Master the Async/Await Syntax**:
   - Learn how to declare asynchronous functions using `async def` and pause execution using `await`.

3. **Get Hands-On with the `asyncio` Library**:
   - Execute async functions using `asyncio.run()`.
   - Manage multiple concurrent tasks with `asyncio.create_task()` and `asyncio.gather()`.

4. **Work with Async HTTP Requests**:
   - Use the `aiohttp` library to make non-blocking API calls or web requests.
   - Compare performance with synchronous libraries like `requests`.

5. **Develop a Mini Async Project**:
   - Implement a practical example (e.g., an asynchronous web scraper or multi-API data fetcher).

## üõ† Detailed Tasks & Exercises:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the Basics of Asynchronous Programming

#### Concept Overview:
- **Synchronous**: Code executes line by line; one task must finish before the next starts.
- **Asynchronous**: Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently; ideal for I/O-bound operations.

#### Exercise:
- Write a short script that simulates blocking tasks (e.g., using `time.sleep()`) and then refactor it using asynchronous methods with `asyncio.sleep()`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn and Practice Async/Await Syntax

#### Syntax Essentials:
- Define async functions with `async def function_name():`.
- Use `await` to pause an async function until an awaited task completes.

#### Exercise:
- Create a simple async function that waits for a few seconds (using `await asyncio.sleep(2)`) and prints a message.
- Chain several async functions together to see how they execute.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dive into the `asyncio` Library

#### Core Functions to Explore:
- **`asyncio.run()`**: Runs the main entry point of an async program.
- **`asyncio.create_task()`**: Schedules an async function to run concurrently.
- **`asyncio.gather()`**: Runs multiple async functions concurrently and collects their results.

#### Exercise:
- Write a script that:
  - Defines multiple async functions (e.g., simulating API calls with `asyncio.sleep()`).
  - Uses `asyncio.create_task()` to run them concurrently.
  - Uses `asyncio.gather()` to wait for all tasks to finish and then prints their results.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Async HTTP Requests with `aiohttp`

#### Setup:
- Install `aiohttp` (if you haven't already):
  ```bash
  pip install aiohttp

## üõ† Practical Exercise: Async Web Scraper or API Fetcher

### Objective:
Write a small async web scraper or API fetcher.

### Steps:
1. Import `aiohttp` and create an async function that fetches data from a URL.
2. Use `aiohttp.ClientSession()` to make GET requests.
3. Process and print the JSON response or the status code.

### Tip:
- Compare this approach with a synchronous request using the `requests` library to understand performance benefits.

---

## üõ† Build a Mini Project: Asynchronous Web Scraper

### Project Outline:
**Objective**: Fetch data from multiple URLs concurrently.

### Steps:
1. List several URLs to fetch data from.
2. Create an async function to request and retrieve data from each URL.
3. Use `asyncio.gather()` to run all fetch operations concurrently.
4. Process the data (e.g., extract titles, status codes, or key information) and display it.

### Exercise:
- Build this project step by step and document your progress.
- Optionally, save the fetched data into a file or a data structure for further analysis.

---

## üõ† Bonus Challenge (Optional)

### Task:
Convert an existing synchronous web scraper into an asynchronous one.

### Steps:
1. Identify a simple script that uses `requests` for web scraping.
2. Refactor it to use `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for concurrent fetching.

### Measure and Compare:
- Measure and compare the performance improvements (execution time and resource usage) between the synchronous and asynchronous versions.

### Discussion:
- Document the differences in execution time and resource usage between the synchronous and asynchronous versions.

## üéØ Goal for Day 7:
By the end of today, you should:
- Grasp the core principles of asynchronous programming and how they differ from synchronous execution.
- Confidently write and run async functions using `async/await` along with `asyncio`.
- Apply async programming techniques in a practical project (such as a web scraper or concurrent API fetcher).
- Understand the performance benefits of asynchronous programming for I/O-bound tasks.
