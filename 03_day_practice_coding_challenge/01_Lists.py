# print(most_common([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 5])) # 5
# print(most_common([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])) # 1

# Explanation
# in this function we use predefined functions like set() and max() to find the most 
# common element in the list.
# set() function is used to remove the duplicate elements from the list.
# max() function is used to find the maximum element in the list.   
# key=lst.count is used to count the number of times the element is repeated in the list.
# the element which is repeated the most number of times is the most common element in the list.
# but there is a problem with this function. if there are two elements which are repeated the
# same number of times then the function will return the first element which is repeated the 
# most number of times.
# for example, if the list is [2, 2, 4, 4] then the function will return 2 but the correct answer
#  is 2 and 4 both are repeated the same number of times.
# so this function is not perfect but it will work in most cases.


# Now writing another custom function to find the most common element in the list.

def most_common_element(lst):
    # create a dictionary to store the count of each element in the list.
    numbers_count = {}
    # iterate through the list and count the number of times each element is repeated.
    for num in lst:
        # if the element is already in the dictionary then increment the count by 1.
        if num in numbers_count:
            numbers_count[num] += 1
        # if the element is not in the dictionary then add the element to the dictionary and set the count to 1.
        else:
            numbers_count[num] = 1
    # find the maximum count in the dictionary.
    max_count = max(numbers_count.values())
    # create a list to store the most common elements.
    results = []
    # Iterate through the dictionary and find the element which is repeated the most number of times.
    for key,value in numbers_count.items():
        # if the value is equal to the maximum count then return the key.
        if value == max_count:
            # append the key to the list
            results.append(key)
    return results
        
# print(most_common_element([1, 2, 2, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
# print(most_common_element([1, 1, 2, 2]))     # Output: 1 or 2
# print(most_common_element(['a', 'b', 'a']))  # Output: 'a'







# now this function works properly but the issue is that code is too long for this simple task.

def most_common_elements(lst):
    numbers_count = {}
    for num in lst:
        numbers_count[num] = numbers_count.get(num, 0) + 1
    max_count = max(numbers_count.values())
    result = [key for key, value in numbers_count.items() if value == max_count]
    return result

# now this function is shorter than the previous function and it works properly.
# print(most_common_elements([1, 2, 2, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
# print(most_common_elements([1, 1, 2, 2]))     # Output: 1 or 2
# print(most_common_elements(['a', 'b', 'a']))  # Output: 'a'



# so in this case we apply all steps to solve
# this problem and we have solved this problem using two different approaches.
# the first approach is to use the predefined functions to solve the problem.
# the second approach is to write a custom function to solve the problem.
# the second approach is better because it is more accurate and it works in all cases.
# the first approach is not accurate because it will return the first element which is repeated the most number of times.
# so the second approach is better than the first approach.
