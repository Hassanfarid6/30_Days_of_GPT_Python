# Explanation:

# We define a function find_max_min that takes a list lst as input.
# If the list is empty, return None for both max and min.
# Initialize max_val and min_val with the first element of the list.
# Iterate through the list, updating max_val if we find a larger number and min_val if we find a smaller number.
# Return the pair of values. This has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.
