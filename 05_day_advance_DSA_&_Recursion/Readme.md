## üìå Objectives for Today:

### Master Recursion:
- Understand the principles of recursion, including base cases and recursive cases.
- Practice writing recursive functions to solve common problems.

### Explore Advanced Data Structures:
- Learn about trees and graphs, their structures, and when to use them.
- Implement basic operations on these data structures.

## üõ† Tasks & Exercises:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion Fundamentals

#### Learn the Concepts:
- Understand the **base case** and **recursive case**.
- Study common recursive algorithms such as:
  - Factorial calculation.
  - Fibonacci sequence.
  - Binary search.

#### Hands-On Exercises:
- Write a recursive function to compute the **factorial** of a number.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Data Structures: Trees & Graphs

#### Trees:
- Learn about **binary trees**, including traversal methods:
  - Inorder.
  - Preorder.
  - Postorder.
- **Exercise:** Create a simple binary tree in Python and implement recursive traversal methods.

#### Graphs:
- Get an introduction to **graphs** (nodes and edges) and common representations:
  - Adjacency list.
  - Adjacency matrix.
- **Exercise:** Represent a graph using an adjacency list and implement a recursive **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.
