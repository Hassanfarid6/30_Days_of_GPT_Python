# Lists

# Mutable, ordered collections of items. Items can be changed, added, or removed.

# Example 1: Grocery List
# ______________________________________________________

grocery_list = ["apples", "bananas", "milk"]

grocery_list.append("bread")

print(grocery_list)

# Explanation: 
    
# This list stores a collection of grocery items in a specific order. You can modify it, 
# e.g., append "bread" with grocery_list.append("bread"), making it ["apples", "bananas",
#  "milk", "bread"].


# Example 2: Numbers
# ______________________________________________________
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
numbers[1] = 25
print(numbers)

# Explanation: 
#  A list of integers in sequence. Being mutable, you could change an element, e.g.,
#  numbers[1] = 25, resulting in [10, 25, 30, 40].


# Example 3: Mixed Types

mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

print(mixed_list)

# Explanation:
#     Lists can hold different data types (integers, strings, floats, booleans). 
# The order is preserved, and you can access elements by index, e.g., mixed_list[1] 
# returns "hello".
