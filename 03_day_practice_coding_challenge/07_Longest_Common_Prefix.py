# Question: Longest Common Prefix
# Problem:

# Write a function longest_common_prefix(strs) that takes a list of strings strs as input and
# returns the longest common prefix shared by all strings in the list. If there is no common 
# prefix, return an empty string. The prefix must be a contiguous sequence of characters that 
# appears at the beginning of every string in the list.

# Requirements:

# Handle edge cases like an empty list or single-element list.
# The solution should work efficiently for strings of varying lengths.

# Examples:
# longest_common_prefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"]) → "fl" (all start with "fl")
# longest_common_prefix(["dog", "racecar", "car"]) → "" (no common prefix)
# longest_common_prefix(["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"]) → "inter" (common prefix is "inter")
# longest_common_prefix(["throne", "throne"]) → "throne" (identical strings)
# longest_common_prefix([]) → "" (empty list)

# Plan:
# 1. If the list is empty, return an empty string.
# 2. Sort the list of strings to find the shortest string.
# 3. Iterate through the characters of the shortest string.
# 4. Check if the character is present in all the strings.
# 5. If the character is present in all the strings, add it to the prefix.
# 6. If the character is not present in all the strings, return the prefix.
# 7. If the loop completes, return the prefix.

def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    strs.sort()
    prefix = ""
    # loop through the characters of the shortest string
    for i in range(len(strs[0])):
        # check if the character is present in all the strings
        if all(strs[0][i] == s[i] for s in strs):
            prefix += strs[0][i]
        else:
            return prefix
    return prefix

# Test cases
print(longest_common_prefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"])) # "fl"
print(longest_common_prefix(["dog", "racecar", "car"])) # ""
print(longest_common_prefix(["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"])) # "inter"
print(longest_common_prefix(["throne", "throne"])) # "throne"


# this code is working properly but not readable. I will refactor it to make it more readable.

# Refactored code:

def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    """Find the longest common prefix among a list of strings."""
    # Handle empty list case
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # If only one string, it’s the prefix
    if len(strs) == 1:
        return strs[0]
    
    # Sort the list to compare the most different strings
    strs.sort()
    first = strs[0]  # Shortest prefix candidate after sorting
    last = strs[-1]  # Longest differing string after sorting
    prefix = ""
    
    # Compare characters of the first and last strings
    for i in range(len(first)):
        # If characters match, add to prefix
        
        if i < len(last) and first[i] == last[i]:
            prefix += first[i]
        else:
            # Stop at the first mismatch
            break
    
    return prefix
