# What Are Context Managers?
# A context manager in Python is a mechanism that allows you to allocate and 
# release resources precisely when you want to, ensuring proper setup and cleanup
# even if errors occur. The most common use case is handling files—opening them 
# for use and ensuring they’re closed afterward—but context managers are versatile
# and can manage any resource or state.

# The primary tool for using context managers is the with statement, which simplifies
#  resource management by automating cleanup.

# Basic Example: File Handling
# Here’s a classic example of a context manager in action:

# with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
#     data = f.read()
#     print(data)
    # Work with the file
# File is automatically closed here, even if an error occurs

# open('file.txt', 'r') is a context manager that opens the file.
# as f assigns the file object to the variable f.
# When the with block ends (or an exception occurs), the file is automatically closed.
# This ensures the file is properly closed, preventing resource leaks, without you needing
#  to call f.close() explicitly.


# Creating Context Managers
# Python provides two primary ways to define custom context managers:

# Class-based context managers (using __enter__ and __exit__ methods).
# Generator-based context managers (using the @contextmanager decorator).
# 1. Class-Based Context Managers
# To create a context manager with a class, define a class with two special methods:

# __enter__: Called when entering the with block; it sets up the resource and returns it.
# __exit__: Called when exiting the with block; it cleans up the resource and can handle
#  exceptions.


# _____________________________________________________________
# 1. Class-Based Context Managers
# _____________________________________________________________

# class MyContextManager:
#     def __enter__(self):
#         print("Entering the context")
#         return "Resource"  # The resource to use in the with block

#     def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
#         print("Exiting the context")
#         if exc_type:  # Check if an exception occurred
#             print(f"An exception occurred: {exc_value}")
#         # Return False (default) to propagate exceptions, or True to suppress them

# # Using the context manager
# with MyContextManager() as resource:
#     print(f"Using the resource: {resource}")
#     # Uncomment to test exception handling:
#     raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

# _____________________________________________________________
# 2. Generator-Based Context Managers
# _____________________________________________________________

# from contextlib import contextmanager

# @contextmanager
# def my_context_manager():
#     print("Entering the context")
#     try:
#         yield "Resource"  # Provide the resource to the with block
#     except Exception as e:
#         print(f"An exception occurred: {e}")
#     finally:
#         print("Exiting the context")

# # Using the context manager
# with my_context_manager() as resource:
#     print(f"Using the resource: {resource}")
#     # Uncomment to test exception handling:
#     raise ValueError("Something went wrong")


# Comparing the Two Approaches


# Feature	            Class-Based	                        Generator-Based
# Complexity	        More verbose, explicit control	    Simpler, less code
# Exception Handling	Via __exit__ arguments	            Via try/except around yield
# Suppress Exceptions	Return True in __exit__	            Handle in except block
# Use Case	            Complex logic, state management	    Simple setup/teardown

# _____________________________________________________________

# with open('file.txt', 'r') as f1, open('file.txt', 'r') as f2:
#     data1 = f1.read()
#     data2 = f2.read()
#     print(data1)
#     print(data2)
#     # Work with both files
    

# # For dynamic numbers of context managers, use contextlib.ExitStack:
# from contextlib import ExitStack

# files = ['file.txt', 'file.txt', 'file.txt']
# with ExitStack() as stack:
#     file_objects = [stack.enter_context(open(f, 'r')) for f in files]
    
#     # Use file_objects as a list of open files
#     # ExitStack ensures all contexts are properly exited, even if exceptions occur.

# 2. Advnace (Temporary State Changes)
# _____________________________________________________________

# #Context managers excel at temporary changes, like switching directories:

# import os
# from contextlib import contextmanager

# @contextmanager
# def change_dir(new_dir):
#     old_dir = os.getcwd()
#     os.chdir(new_dir)
#     try:
#         yield
#     finally:
#         os.chdir(old_dir)

# # Usage
# print(f"Original dir: {os.getcwd()}")
# with change_dir('/tmp'):
#     print(f"New dir: {os.getcwd()}")
# print(f"Back to: {os.getcwd()}")

# # Original dir: /home/user
# # New dir: /tmp
# # Back to: /home/user
