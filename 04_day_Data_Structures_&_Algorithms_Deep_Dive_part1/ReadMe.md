# 🚀 Day 4: Data Structures & Algorithms Deep Dive (Part 1)

Today, you’ll master essential data structures used in Python and understand how algorithms work. This will help you write efficient, optimized code, which is crucial for AI Agents & GenAI development.

---

## 📌 Objectives for Today:
- ✅ Learn Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries in-depth.
- ✅ Understand when to use each data structure.
- ✅ Practice basic searching & sorting algorithms.
- ✅ Solve 5+ coding problems related to data structures.

---

## 🛠 Tasks & Exercises:

### 1️⃣ Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- ✅ **Lists** → Mutable, ordered collections.  
  Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- ✅ **Tuples** → Immutable, ordered collections.  
  Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`
- ✅ **Sets** → Unordered, unique elements.  
  Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
- ✅ **Dictionaries** → Key-value pairs.  
  Example: `my_dict = {"name": "Obaid", "age": 19}`

#### 🔹 Exercises:
- Write Python programs to:
  - Find the most frequent element in a list.
  - Convert a list into a set to remove duplicates.
  - Merge two dictionaries.

---

### 2️⃣ Searching & Sorting Algorithms (Basic)
- ✅ **Linear Search** → Find an element in a list.
- ✅ **Binary Search** → Find an element in a sorted list (more efficient).
- ✅ **Bubble Sort** → Basic sorting algorithm for understanding sorting.

#### 🔹 Exercises:
- Implement Linear Search and Binary Search in Python.
- Sort a list using Bubble Sort.
- Compare their time complexities (Big O notation).

---

### 3️⃣ Solve 5+ Coding Problems (LeetCode, CodeWars, or HackerRank)
#### 🔹 Beginner-Friendly Problems:
- ✅ Find the maximum and minimum in a list.
- ✅ Check if two lists have common elements.
- ✅ Remove duplicates from a list.
- ✅ Implement Binary Search in a sorted list.
- ✅ Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

---

## 📌 Extra Challenge (Optional)
- Solve LeetCode’s ["Merge Two Sorted Lists"](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/).

---

## 🎯 Goal for Today:
By the end of Day 4, you should have:
- ✅ Mastered Python’s core data structures.
- ✅ Implemented basic searching & sorting algorithms.
- ✅ Solved 5+ data structure-related problems.
