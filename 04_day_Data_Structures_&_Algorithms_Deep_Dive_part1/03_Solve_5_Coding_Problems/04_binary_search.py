# Explanation:

# Binary search works on a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.
# Initialize left and right pointers to the start and end of the list.
# Calculate the middle index mid. If lst[mid] is the target, return its index.
# If lst[mid] is less than the target, search the right half (left = mid + 1).
# If lst[mid] is greater, search the left half (right = mid - 1).
# If the pointers cross (left > right), the target isnâ€™t in the list, so return -1.
# Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the length of the list.
